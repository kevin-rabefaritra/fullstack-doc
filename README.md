# Full-stack doc
Various compiled docs for full-stack people, but mainly about **Java** and **Spring Boot**.

## Spring
Spring related documentation. This assumes that you already have some knownledge with Spring Core / Boot, we try to go beyond the classic *Entity-Repository-Service-Controller* stuff (follow the [official courses](https://spring.academy/) otherwise!).
